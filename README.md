# builtinPluginsHook

This is a [Pengu Loader](https://pengu.lol) Plugin

This plugin allows you to hook any `Riot Client Plguin` loaded into LeagueClient.

Some people from Pengu Community may wonder how [BenchKiller](https://github.com/BakaFT/BenchKiller/) works, well this repo has the source code of it.

**THIS PLUGIN WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT `BenchKiller` DO IF YOU PUT IT UNDER `plugins` DIRECTLY**

# How it Works?
